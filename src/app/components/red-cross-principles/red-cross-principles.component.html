    Seven Fundamental Principles of Red Cross
    <span class="line"></span>
  </h2>

  <ul class="principles-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Humanity</strong>
      <p>
        The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, born of a desire
        to bring assistance without discrimination to the wounded on the
        battlefield, endeavors, in its international and national capacity, to
        prevent and alleviate human suffering wherever it may be found. Its
        purpose is to protect life and health and to ensure respect for the
        human being. It promotes mutual understanding, friendship, cooperation,
        and lasting peace amongst all peoples.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Impartiality</strong>
      <p>
        It makes no discrimination as to nationality, race, religious beliefs,
        class, or political opinions. It endeavors to relieve the suffering of
        individuals, being solely by their needs, and to give priority to the
        most urgent cases of distress.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Neutrality</strong>
      <p>
        In order to enjoy the confidence of all, the Movement may not take sides
        in hostilities or engage in controversies of a political, racial,
        religious, or ideological nature.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Independence</strong>
      <p>
        The Movement is independent. The National Societies, while auxiliaries
        in the humanitarian services of their governments and subject to the
        laws of their respective countries, must always maintain their autonomy
        so that they may be able at all times to act in accordance with the
        principles of the Movement.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Voluntary Service</strong>
      <p>
        It is a voluntary relief movement not prompted in any manner by desire
        for gain.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Unity</strong>
      <p>
        There can be only one Red Cross or one Red Crescent Society in any one
        country.
      </p>
    </li>
