        During the first world war in 1914, India had no organization for relief
        services to the affected soldiers, except a branch of the St. John
        Ambulance Association and by a Joint Committee of the British Red Cross.
        Later, a branch of the same Committee was started to undertake the much
        needed relief services in collaboration with the St. John Ambulance
        Association in aid of the soldiers as well as civilian sufferers of the
        horrors of that great war. A bill to constitute the Indian Red Cross
        Society, Independent of the British Red Cross, was introduced in the
        Indian Legislative Council on 3rd March 1920 by Sir Claude Hill, member
        of the Viceroy's Executive Council who was also Chairman of the Joint
        war Committee in India . The Bill was passed on 17th March 1920 and
        became Act XV of 1920 with the assent of the Governor General on the
        20th March 1920 .
